# Titanic Survival Analysis

In this analysis, we analyze demographic data of passengers on board the RMS Titanic, the famous ship that sunk on April 15, 1912. We try to identify factors that led some groups of people to be more likely to survive than others. The analysis and accompanying explanations are contained within the jupyter notebook `titanic-analysis.ipynb`.
